# Motor Motion Ctl

This microcontroller code is designed to run on the STM32G431 family of processors. The initial code was generated by
the STMCubeMX application for Microsoft Windows. To compile this project the STMCubeIDE is needed. After downloading,
open the project file and click the build button.

## Implementation Notes

This file holds some notes about the test implementation that I am using to show off a final implementation for this
section of the project.

### Encoder

The encoder that I am using for testing is a [Bourns Audio
3315](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/bourns-inc/3315C-001-016L/3315C-001-016L-ND/2537720). This encoder has a
counting range from 0-16. An encoder counting range is the number of mechanical ticks that an encoder has. Usually an
range of 0-16 is pretty good for user input. For motor applications this number is very low. A low resolution means that
the mapping from ticks to degrees is of low resolution. With the current test configuration I was able to get a mapping
of around **5 degrees per tick on the encoder**. In a production motion control system this would be abysmal. For the
testing application it should be good enough to show that something is working.

### PWM System

PWM for an actual motor control situation would be designed more strictly. In this demonstrations example I set the PWM
period to a reasonable default that will clearly show the system working. In an actual motor control situation the
period and duty cycle would have to match the motor under control. Since I do not have an actual motor for testing I had
to make some liberal default value choices. To make the math easy, I chose a PWM period of 1ms with 360 duty cycle
deviations. That means that the duty cycle can be set in increments of 360. As an example, a 50% duty cycle would have a
value of 180 in the counter compare register. This simplification makes the conversion from encoder ticks to PWM output
straightforward. A 1ms period makes visualization on an oscilloscope easy.

When the system is powered on the PWM output is disabled by default. To enable the output send a 55 AA 01 52 message.
